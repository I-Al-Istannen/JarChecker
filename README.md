## JarChecker

JarChecker version 0.4

JarChecker was created by bwfcwalshy with help and input from ArsenArsen and I Al Istannen. JarChecker is a program created to check jar files for malicious content. This project was made for use in the Bukkit Forums to protect server owners and people in need of plugins from malicious content. The program is still very much in development and has much to go before it is done.
